# AI Tunisia Hackathon Financial Inclusion

This is a solution for Financial Inclusion evaluation problem for the AI Hack Tunisia. 

- AI HACK TUNISIA (https://www.ai-hack-tunisia.com/)


I Tried several models: Logistic Regression, GaussianNB, KNeighborsClassifier, LinearSVC, and finally SVC. 

SVC could reach 88.48% accuracy. 

In the `main.py` file there is a playground for how I got there using plots and different charts to identify what is important in the model.

In `svc.py` there is the neat solution using Support Vector Machine.

Enjoy.
